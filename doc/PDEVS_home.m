%% About
% This Toolbox is based on the Discrete EVent System Specification (DEVS) and
% its associated abstract simulator algorithms introduced by Zeigler in 1976.
% It implements a PDEVS simulator with ports and also offers an experimental status
% of hybrid simulation by allowing the definition of continuous variables within atomic models.
% Usage requires a general understanding of how DEVS algorithms and DEVS modeling works.
% The MatlabDEVS Tbx comes with some example models for pure discrete and hybrid scenarios
% and also QSS-based models. DEVS-based approaches are relatively unknown in the engineering community.
% So we hope to contribute in bringing DEVS to engineers by providing it for
% Matlab(R).
% 
% You can download the toolbox
% <https://www.mb.hs-wismar.de/cea/DEVS_Tbx/MatlabDEVS_Tbx.html here>.
%
% *The MatlabDEVS Toolbox offers the following features:*
%
% * Lean GUI to run some examples,
% * Simulator and coordinator classes,
% * Root coordinators for simulation of pure discrete or hybrid models,
% * Debug modes,
% * Templates for user defined atomic and coupled models,
% * Modelbase containing reusable atomic and coupled models,
% * Examples, including QSS and hybrid models,
% * Automatic recording of states in atomic models over time during simulation,
% * Methods to check plausibility of models.
%
%% Installation
% The install instructions are based upon a former successful Matlab R2016a
% (or higher) installation. The software is tested with 32/64 bit Windows 7
% and Ubuntu 16.04 but should also work with other operating systems.
%
% Unzip the downloaded file and copy it to your harddisk into a specified folder.
% Add the folder including any subfolders to the path variable within Matlab
% (Menue: File -> Set Path -> Add with subfolders).
% 
% Alternatively install as Matlab's App:
% goto Tab APPS --> install Apps --> choose MatlabDEVS.mlappinstall -->
% done ;-)
%
%
%% Quick Start
% After installation run _MatlabDEVS_ from Apps or type |MatlabDEVS| at Matlab prompt.
% The GUI will offer you access to this documentation and allows you to run
% some of the examples choosing different time intervals and debug modes.

%
%% Getting Help
% You already found this HTML-documentation --> excellent!
% So you can browse it in your standard browser.
%
% MatlabDEVS also integrates into Matlab's help browser. After having added
% Tbx's folder to the path, you can access the help files via the _Supplemental
% Software_ tab in help browser and also search for keywords.

%
%% Class Hierarchy
% The DEVS simulation environment and model definitions are programmed following
% the object oriented approach. 
% For atomics, base classes act as associated simulators, derived classes
% are the models. The modeler has to implement models by deriving new classes from |atomic| and |hybridatomic| respectively.
% For the coupled, the classes |coupled| and |hybridcoupled| respectively act as
% coordinators and as models either. Alternatively, it is possible to
% derive user defined coupled models from class |coupled| and
% |hybridcoupled|, if you want to save them for reuse.

%
%% Simulator
% 
% *Root Coordinators:*
%
% * root coordinator (pure discrete simulation) --> <simulator/r_c_discrete.html r_c_discrete>
% * root coordinator (hybrid simulation) --> <simulator/r_c_hybrid.html r_c_hybrid>
%
% *Associated Simulators and Coordinators:*
%
% * coordinator (discrete) AND model --> <simulator/coupled.html coupled>
% * coordinator (hybrid) AND model --> <simulator/hybridcoupled.html hybridcoupled>
% * simulator (discrete) --> <simulator/atomic.html atomic>
% * simulator (hybrid) --> <simulator/hybridatomic.html hybridatomic>
% * base class --> <simulator/devs.html devs>
%
% Use of _debug modes_ and call of root coordinators is explained in initialization
% scripts of example models. 
%     
%
%% Modeling
% Find a list of all models provided in *Modelbase* <PDEVS_modelbase.html here>.
%
% All pure discrete atomic models are based on <models/am_discrete_template.html am_discrete_template.m>,
% all hybrid atomic models are based on <models/am_hybrid_template.html am_hybrid_template.m>.
% Discrete coupled models are based on <models/cm_discrete_template.html cm_discrete_template.m>.
% 
%
% To create own atomic models use the templates, define x and y ports,
% states, sytem parameters,
% and fill characteristic functions with the desired behaviour.
% 
% Coupled models are defined by creating instances of class |coupled|
% and |hybrid_coupled| respectively and defining ports, components
% and couplings within initialization scripts.
% For definition of reusable coupled models, you can also derive user
% defined classes from |coupled| or |hybridcoupled|. In this case, the
% constructor of user defined coupled models needs to instantiate all
% submodels and define ports and couplings.
%
% Explore the <PDEVS_examples.html examples> to learn how to define models within initialization
% scripts. Typically, an experiment consists of an initialization script,
% a call of the appropriate root coordinator to start a simulation run, and an analysis
% and/or plot function or script to get simulation results.
%
% To verify that your model is consistent, you can use the *Check* method.
% Pass the outermost model to this method (call: Check(root_model)) and it
% will be checked recursively if:
%
% * all subcomponents are existing,
% * all portnames used in coupling matrices are existing,
% * component(s) define self loops,
% * all existing ports are connected (warning, if unconnected ports are detected).
%
%
%% Debug modes
% The textual debug modes 1 and 2 provide
% information about simulation messages interchanged between associated simulators and coordinators,
% calls of the dynamic functions of atomic models and current input, output and state values. Moreover,
% these modes are well suited for learning PDEVS and for understanding the simulation algorithms. For
% both modes the following can be defined whether the textual output should be written as: (i) standard
% output device (the MATLAB prompt); (ii) standard error device or (iii) a text file.
%
% Debug mode 2
% generates exactly the same output as mode 1 but it operates stepwise. A step is, thereby, not defined as an
% equidistant amount of time but as the distance between two internal events.
%
% The debug mode 3 (for atomics) provides
% an online visual representation of ports and states and their current values.
%
% Each of the three debug modes can be set for the entire model, the root_model or for parts of it, by
% calling the set_debug(obj,mode,out) method and passing the object reference, the debug mode and an
% optional parameter out to define output, if the mode is set to 1 or 2, such as follows:
%
% |set_debug(root_model,1,1)| for entire model, mode=1, out= stdout
%
% |set_debug(...coupled_model,2,2)| for coupled and itâ€™s submodels, mode=2, out= stderr
%
% |set_debug(...atomic_model,3)| for single atomic, mode=3
%
% Setting of debug mode needs to be done before simulation, usually in an
% initialization script.
