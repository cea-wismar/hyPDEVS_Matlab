*********************************************************************

Vers. 1.5 -> 2.0
* packed as Matlab-App

* GUI for entrance and introduction

* Debug modes and internal handling improved
  mode 0 : no messages
  mode 1 : messages and fct.-calls to user defined output (e.g. std-out (default) or a .txt-file) 
  mode 2 : same as 1, but stepwise
  mode 3 : gauges of x, y and s of atomics

* Improved fault tolerant methods for setting ports, states and system parameters



Vers. 1.3 -> 1.5
* User interface changed so that coupled models can be defined as class definitions for reuse,

* Connecting more than one outports to one inport is possible,

* Output and input messages are MATLAB cell arrays now,

* Definition of system parameters (sysparams) for atomic models, which cannot be changed during
  runtime to distinguish them from states (s),

* Fault tolerant methods for setting ports, states and system parameters introduced,

* States in atomic models can be automatically recorded over time during simulation by setting the observe_flag,

* DEBUG parameter can be set locally for selected model parts (is a property of simulators/coordinators),

* New Check() method for coupled models to verify that all subcomponents and all portnames used in coupling matrices are existing,
  that component(s) don't define self loops, and that all existing ports are connected (warning, if unconnected ports are detected).
